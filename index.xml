Prometheus provides us with a useful pattern that allows you to match metadata with scraped metrics and attach new labels.
Why? Useful details can be added to metrics by pulling from a database, source of truth platform such as Netbox or other inventory systems. Say you&amp;rsquo;re scraping node-exporters that are exposing data from a data centre of hypervisors, it might be useful to add additional metadata about each server&amp;rsquo;s geography or data centre location.</description></item><item><title>Common Tasks in LVM</title><link>https://tardoe.github.io/posts/common-tasks-in-lvm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tardoe.github.io/posts/common-tasks-in-lvm/</guid><description>Because dealing with LVM is a fairly uncommon task for me, I tend to find myself googling these same procedures over and over again. They are documented here for my own benefit and anyone else that is looking for a clean, simple process document.
I pretty much use Ubuntu exclusively, so these examples are all in Jammy 22.04 LTS.
